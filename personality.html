                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>My given type from the 16 personalities Myers-Briggs quiz is <b>Architect INTJ-T</b></p>
                        <p>For the online VARK (visual, auditory, reading, kinesthetic) test I was found to be <b>kinesthetic</b></p>
                        <p>For the Divergent Association Task creativity test my result of <b>92.67</b> ranked in the top <b>1.4%</b></p>

                        <h3>What These Tests Mean to Me</h3>
                        <p>I feel that the personality test is quite accurate with regards to how I feel about many of my workplace decisions and relationships. Many of the examples provided in the 
                        long-form description of the Architect INTJ-T personality type really resonated with me and almost normalised how I feel in certain workplace/social settings. This personality 
                        type prefers smaller teams, often to be left to their own devices with problems, and have a strong desire to be heard in group decision making processes but not necessarily 
                        being the person steering the ship (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2011).
                        </p>
                        <p>The learning style test is a little vague as I have preferences for how I like to learn based on what type of information or skill I am trying to acquire. For example, 
                        I prefer to watch a video discussing something I am less familiar with and prefer to read a report on a topic I am more confident in for example.
                        </p>
                        <p>The divergent thinking creativity test was interesting in that it expanded my view on what creativity encapsulates. There is a fantastic report available on their website 
                        detailing why they designed the test to be the way it is and the limitations behind what it’s scoring system implies.  Creativity more than simply coming up with unique 
                        ideas/concepts on the fly. That said, it felt pretty good to score that high.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Influence on MY Behaviour in a Team</h3>
                        <p>The personality test definitely influences the way I behave in teams. I have a preference for working in small teams amongst peers of a similar skill set or experience 
                        level and like to be given a little more freedom in my decision making as opposed to being led by a headstrong, ‘my-way-or-the-highway’ kind of leader (attributes highlighted 
                        in my Myers-Briggs result). My job is quite hands-on, so the kinaesthetic learning/teaching style works well for me in this setting. With the creativity test, I do tend to 
                        perform my best or have the most valuable input when jumping in with alternative ideas off someone else’s core plan/system.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How Should I Take This Into Account When Forming Teams?</h3>
                        <p>I should be aware of my preferences and take these into consideration in the case where I do not get to choose my team to prevent potential disagreements. If I am familiar 
                        with the people I am forming a group with, it would be handy to set up roles and discuss how people like to work in the early stages, or even before groups are finalised. 
                        A team project works best when people are open with each other and open to sharing their ideas.
                        </p>

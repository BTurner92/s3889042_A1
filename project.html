                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>I plan to design a website called CompBiOverview, that will serve as an introduction to the field of bioinformatics. It will be both a simple, central point from which to undertake 
                            a lot of basic computational biology tasks (eg. sequence alignments, nucleotide to amino acid sequence conversions) and an educational resource clearly outlining the varied fields 
                            covered within bioinformatics. As a public repository on GitHub, many of the programs will all be able to be downloaded and used as a learning resource for those interested in 
                            learning the software side of things. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Currently, there are many free sequence alignment tools like Needle, molecular simulators like VMD, and sequence conversion tools like Transeq available online. 
                        The downside is that when starting out, you don’t know what tools are available, how to use them, the best scenarios to use certain tools, or what these tools are capable of. 
                        CompBiOverview solves the issue by compiling a series of the most prevalent software tools into one place with the added benefit of allowing anyone to download and play with 
                        the code (assuming it is open source) or write their own!
                        </p>
                        <p>The field is surprisingly broad, with many different specialist pathways such as genomics, data visualisation, and biostatistics. Another issue I find with many of the introductory 
                        resources available online is that they are provided by specialists and thus tend to be too narrow in scope or lack context.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>CompBiOverview is to be a website on GitHub Pages, accompanying a GitHub repository that will serve as an educational resource designed to aid those who have taken an interest into 
                        computational biology/bioinformatics and may not know where to begin.
                        </p>
                        <p>My idea is to structure the site/repository like a mind map, with a series of branches heading off the core introductory sections. My aim is to keep the learning flow as clear as 
                        possible, utilising simple tools such as colour coding and font cues to denote different topic areas or specialisations (green for genomics, purple for drug discovery for example).
                        </p>
                        <p>I plan to have a section of the site dedicated to running bioinformatics tools such as a global sequence aligner, pairwise aligner, nucleotide to amino acids sequence converter 
                        and a molecular 3D visualisation window. Any other great available tools will be laid out via links and screenshots, with full credit going to the original creators and those 
                        involved in maintaining the software(s).
                        </p>
                        <p>For any tools that were designed by me or other collaborators, or those that may have open-source licences, the source code and/or isolated code modules will be available for 
                        download via the GitHub repository for learning and editing purposes.
                        </p>
                        <p>With a strong enough community, these could become fantastic resources of collaboration and a great asset to both the page and the user’s GitHub profiles, aiming to continually 
                        improve the tools and our collective skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>In my own research, I have found plenty of amazing databases, software tools and career advice posts, but what is lacking are simple tips and tricks for how to use them and tutorials 
                        that provide context. More to the point, I will create features that allow community members to add their own findings and reviews regarding these resources. Something as simple as a well 
                        laid out comment section can make all the difference in promoting discussion and debate amongst engaged community members.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most importantly, I will include a forum section much like the Canvas discussion forums or a subreddit. From personal experience, the bioinformatics subreddit is a minefield of 
                        disgruntled professionals and people communicating in jargon so dense they appear to be speaking in another language. On the other hand, the YouTube comments sections of many videos 
                        is bombarded by a sea of people parroting questions like “What programming language should I learn?”, and “How do I get a job in the industry?”. Whilst these are valid questions, they 
                        are a prime example of learning to run before you can walk, asking questions about the end goal when you are beginning does not help improve your skills. Motivation and inspiration are 
                        great but content is king.
                        </p>
                        <p>This has the possibility to be expanded on utilising other programs such as a Discord server, and Patreon memberships to help cover any admin associated costs whilst offering increased 
                        access to ‘senior’ forum members or small group help sessions (if the forum/page were to grow to a significant size where these sorts of procedures were required).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Required Tools and Technologies</h3>
                        <p>Evidently, all the tools and technologies involved here will be software based. GitHub and GitHub Pages hosting services will be a major backbone in the initial stages. Computational 
                        biology programs are predominantly written using Python, or R, both of which have an abundance of biology and data science specific packages enabling streamlined performance of tasks 
                        such as graphical representations of data. Some of these include Astropy, Biopython, DEAP, NumPy, and matplotlib to name a few, most of which are freely available and open source.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Required Skills</h3>
                        <p>With my current skill set and the direction of my learning, I feel that the conversion tools would be relatively easy to produce, if time consuming using python and some of the libraries 
                        mentioned above. Sequence alignment tools are a little more complex. Designing a program to compete with Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, for example, would be worthy of publication in journal 
                        such as Science or Nature. That said, the primary aim of the project is not necessarily to code everything myself, but to expose others to what is out there and provide examples of how to 
                        use the tools. A significant portion of the skills required would be around HTML or CSS in web design for which there are many great online resources such as w3 and Scrimba to help.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The fantastic thing about this project is that even if no one else likes it, contributes, or even visits the page, it will still be a success as I will have learned an incredible 
                        amount in the process of getting it all set up.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, a bustling online community of engaged, enthusiastic people and collaborating on projects would be a terrific result. I know there are others like me out there who want to 
                        learn more but do not know where to begin. In creating an accessible, comfortable environment for people to get their head around bioinformatics I will have ‘solved the problem’ by 
                        encouraging more people like me to take an interest in this subject which I see as the future of biology.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <p>I am an AV and lighting technician with an associate degree in audio production, who has done everything from corporate events to concerts. 
                    In 2020 I finally realised that I wanted out and began studying biology (what I should have done when I left school 10 years ago) at RMIT through 
                    OUA and have absolutely loved it. </p>
                        <p>I grew up in Sydney, with a 5-year stint in Singapore between the ages of 7-12. Currently, I live in Melbourne's inner north with my partner Emma and our pug Pepsi.
                    I have far more hobbies/interests than I have time or money to maintain but the main ones would be guitar, ice hockey, cycling, craft beer, and gaming.</p>

                <div class="sectionContent"></div>
                    <article>
                        <p>I am an AV and lighting technician with an associate degree in audio production, who has done everything from corporate events to concerts. 
                        In 2020 I finally realised that I wanted out and began studying biology (what I should have done when I left school 10 years ago) at RMIT through 
                        OUA and have absolutely loved it. </p>
                        <p>I grew up in Sydney, with a 5-year stint in Singapore between the ages of 7-12. Currently, I live in Melbourne's inner north with my partner Emma and our pug Pepsi.
                        I have far more hobbies/interests than I have time or money to maintain but the main ones would be guitar, ice hockey, cycling, craft beer, and gaming.

                        <h3>My Area of Interest</h3>
                        <p>My interest in IT has always been there as a curiosity but one I never fully explored. Lately, my interest was truly sparked with my exploration of computational biology 
                        as a potential career path. The field of biological sciences is trending in the direction of increasing reliance of computers and data science, with more and more lab 
                        techniques providing massive datasets requiring in depth computer-aided analysis. As a result, I have begun to delve into the world of programming and IT, 
                        which has brought me to this course.
                        </p>

                        <h3>My IT Experience</h3>
                        <p>I have only a surface level of understanding of IT systems through my work as an AV/event technician. Most lighting software for example, is basically a cleverly designed 
                        GUI used to manipulate, write and execute LUA scripts. Most aspects of the job these days involve computers and networking to some extent.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why I Chose RMIT?</h3>
                        <p>Around 7 years ago I was contemplating whether to move to Melbourne to go to RMIT or stay with my parents and go to UNSW in Sydney but did not end up going through with either plan. 
                        Fast forward to 2020, living in Melbourne, in the midst of Covid-19 lockdowns with nothing to do, I googled online science degrees and one of the first to pop up was 
                        Bachelor of Science at RMIT, I took that as a good omen and applied the next day.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What I Expect to Gain from my Studies</h3>
                        <p>From my studies I expect to gain a broad understanding of the IT industry as a whole, what the job market looks like, the future possibilities/where the industry is heading, 
                        and the formation of a skill set that will lay the foundation for my current and future career path(s).
                        </p>

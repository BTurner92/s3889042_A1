                        <h3>Role Description and Appeal</h3>
                        <p>What makes this role most appealing is the company, ever since I found out about CSL I have wanted to figure out how I could be a part of what they do. 
                        They are a biotechnology company specialising in researching and designing vaccines, drugs, antivenoms, and other lifesaving technologies. 
                        The role advertised is that of a senior data engineer, responsible for structuring and maintaining data storage systems, enabling easy access and analysis 
                        by data scientists and bioinformaticians. With other key roles being in support of the data scientists and researchers to troubleshoot errors and improve data modelling capabilities.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Description of Required Skills</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Bachelor’s or master’s in computer science, data science, software engineering, bioinformatics or related fields.</li>
                            <li>Advanced programming knowledge and skills (5+ years) utilising languages such as python, R, SAS, SQL, and other database query languages.</li>
                            <li>Advanced knowledge of Data science and visualisation concepts (tools and applications).</li>

                            <li>Experience in handling both structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources (real world, lab, clinical etc.)</li>
                            <li>A familiarity with Amazon Web Service or other cloud platforms.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>My Skills, Qualifications, and Experience</h3>
                        <p>I do not have any complete formal qualifications related to this role and my skills are a far cry from those required at this current point in time. I hold a strong 
                        foundational knowledge in scientific principles, and I am gaining a foundation in IT and programming however I currently lack the experience and deep technical skills 
                        for a role such as this.
                        </p>

                        <h3>My Plan to Gain Necessary Skills</h3>
                        <p>My goal upon completing my bachelor’s degree is to continue with my studies with either a Masters or PhD in bioinformatics, during which I will be gaining some of 
                        the data handling and programming skills laid out in this job ad. There are also a number of fantastic online resources available for learning programming and data science principles 
                        such as Khan Academy, Coursera, w3, and Codecademy to name a few that I will utilise to improve my skills in these areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>As this is a senior data senior data engineer, a more junior level data science position in a related field such as with a hospital or research facility would be my ideal 
                        way to earn the requisite 5+ years of experience in the field and prepare myself any data science/management skills required for the CSL role.
                        </p>
